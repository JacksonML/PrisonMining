<h1>PrisonMining</h1><br>
<p>PrisonMining is still in development, and is expected to change dramatically. I do not recommend using the plugin until it is ready to be released.</p>
<p>PrisonMining is supposed to be like the plugin Prison Mine or similar plugins on PC Bukkit, but designed for a mobile experience!</p>
